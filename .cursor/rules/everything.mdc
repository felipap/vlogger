# Your rule content

- Try-catch blocks should be small and targeted at a particular thing that could fail.

## Frontend

- Always use braces. Ie. don't do "if (x) return y;"
- In the frontend, calls to the API should be put into separate functions. Perhaps in the same file as the component that uses it. Perhaps not.
- Don't just put SVGs straight into a bigger component. Break it out into a separate component.
- No default exports except for the page.tsx files.
- Pages default exports should just be called function Page().

## Backend

- Don't worry about migrating the database. I will always do it for you.
